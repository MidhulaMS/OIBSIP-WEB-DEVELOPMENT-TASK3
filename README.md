# OIBSIP-WEB-DEVELOPMENT-TASK3

This repository contains a Temperature Converter Web Application developed as part of the OASIS INFOBYTE Internship – Level 1 Task 3.
The project demonstrates a practical implementation of core web development concepts by allowing users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin through a simple and interactive interface.

The application focuses on clean UI design, user-friendly interaction, and accurate temperature conversion using JavaScript logic.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Temperature Converter allows users to:

Enter a temperature value.

Select the input unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).

Select the target unit.

Instantly view the converted temperature.

This project helps reinforce fundamental frontend development skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and logical problem-solving.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED:

HTML5 – Structure and layout of the web page.

CSS3 – Styling and responsive design.

JavaScript (ES6) – Temperature conversion logic and interactivity.
